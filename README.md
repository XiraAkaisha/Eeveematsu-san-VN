# Eeveematsu-san-VN

----------------------PREFACE-----------------------------

This is my first personal project. I am making a fan game based on a crossover between Osomatsu-san and Pokemon, in a Visual Novel style. This project is simply for fun, and a way for me to practice and develop my Python coding skills.

PROJECT DETAILS

Game name: Eeveematsu-san!
Game type: Visual Novel
Engine used: Renpy
Project Deadline: December 2016

-----------------------------------------------------------

BLURB

Due to a bored Osomatsu playing around with a dimension-distorting laser gun prototype in Dekapan's laboratory, the Matsuno brothers were transported into the Pokemon world when the laser hit the 3DS Jyushimatsu was playing with. They were dropped into an unknown forest, disoriented and confused. But to their horror, they have all been turned into Eevees! They must brave the dangers of predators, trainers and criminal organizations alike as they embark on a journey to return to the human world.

This is a CHOICE-BASED visual novel. The choices the player makes can determine the ending of the story.
